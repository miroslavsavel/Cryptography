in  this standalone short story by n k jemisin author of the fifth season the winner of this years hugo award  for best novel new york city is about to go through a few changes like all  great metropolises before it when a city gets big enough old enough it  must be born but there are ancient enemies who cannot tolerate new life  thus new york will live or die by the efforts of a reluctant midwife and  how well he can learn to sing the citys mighty song
i sing the city
fucking city i stand on the rooftop of a building i dont live in and spread my arms and tighten my middle and yell nonsense ululations at the construction site that blocks my view im really singing to the cityscape beyond the cityll figure it out
its dawn the damp of it makes my jeans feel slimy or maybe thats cause they havent been washed in weeks got change for a washanddry just not another pair of pants to wear till theyre done maybe ill spend it on more pants at the goodwill down the street instead    but not yet not till ive finished going aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa breath aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and listening to the syllable echo back at me from every nearby building face in my head theres an orchestra playing ode to joy with a busta rhymes backbeat my voice is just tying it all together
shut your fucking mouth someone yells so i take a bow and exit the stage
but with my hand on the knob of the rooftop door i stop and turn back and frown and listen cause for a moment i hear something both distant and intimate singing back at me bassodeep sort of coy
and from even farther i hear something else a dissonant gathering growl or maybe those are the rumblers of police sirens nothing i like the sound of either way i leave
theres a way these things are supposed to work says paulo hes smoking again nasty bastard ive never seen him eat all he uses his mouth for is smoking drinking coffee and talking shame its a nice mouth otherwise
were sitting in a cafe im sitting with him because he bought me breakfast the people in the cafe are eyeballing him because hes something notwhite by their standards but they cant tell what theyre eyeballing me because im definitively black and because the holes in my clothes arent the fashionable kind i dont stink but these people can smell anybody without a trust fund from a mile away
right i say biting into the egg sandwich and damn near wetting myself actual egg swiss cheese its so much better than that mcdonalds shit
guy likes hearing himself talk i like his accent its sort of nasal and sibilant nothing like a spanishspeakers his eyes are huge and i think i could get away with so much shit if i had permanent puppy eyes like that but he seems older than he looksway way older theres only a tinge of gray at his temples nice and distinguished but he feels like a hundred
hes also eyeballing me and not in the way im used to are you listening he asks this is important
yeah i say and take another bite of my sandwich
he sits forward i didnt believe it either at first hong had to drag me to one of the sewers down into the reeking dark and show me the growing roots the budding teeth id been hearing breathing all my life i thought everyone could he pauses have you heard it yet
heard what i ask which is the wrong answer it isnt that im not listening i just dont give a shit
he sighs listen
i am listening
no i mean listen but not to me he gets up tosses a twenty onto the tablewhich isnt necessary because he paid for the sandwich and the coffee at the counter and this cafe doesnt do table service meet me back here on thursday
i pick up the twenty finger it pocket it wouldve done him for the sandwich or because i like his eyes but whatever you got a place
he blinks then actually looks annoyed listen he commands again and leaves
i sit there for as long as i can making the sandwich last sipping his leftover coffee savoring the fantasy of being normal i peoplewatch judge other patrons appearances on the fly i make up a poem about being a rich white girl who notices a poor black boy in her coffee shop and has an existential crisis i imagine paulo being impressed by my sophistication and admiring me instead of thinking im just some dumb street kid who doesnt listen i visualize myself going back to a nice apartment with a soft bed and a fridge stuffed full of food
then a cop comes in fat florid guy buying hipster joe for himself and his partner in the car and his flat eyes skim the shop i imagine mirrors around my head a rotating cylinder of them that causes his gaze to bounce away theres no real power in thisits just something i do to try to make myself less afraid when the monsters are near for the first time though it sort of works the cop looks around but doesnt ping on the lone black face lucky i escape
i paint the city back when i was in school there was an artist who came in on fridays to give us free lessons in perspective and lighting and other shit that white people go to art school to learn except this guy had done that and he was black id never seen a black artist before for a minute i thought i could maybe be one too
i can be sometimes deep in the night on a rooftop in chinatown with a spray can for each hand and a bucket of drywall paint that somebody left outside after doing up their living room in lilac i move in scuttling crablike swirls the drywall stuff i cant use too much of itll start flaking off after a couple of rains spray paints better for everything but i like the contrast of the two texturesliquid black on rough lilac red edging the black im painting a hole its like a throat that doesnt start with a mouth or end in lungs a thing that breathes and swallows endlessly never filling no one will see it except people in planes angling toward laguardia from the southwest a few tourists who take helicopter tours and nypd aerial surveillance i dont care what they see its not for them
its real late i didnt have anywhere to sleep for the night so this is what im doing to stay awake if it wasnt the end of the month id get on the subway but the cops who havent met their quota would fuck with me gotta be careful here theres a lot of dumbfuck chinese kids west of chrystie street who wanna pretend to be a gang protecting their territory so i keep low im skinny dark that helps too all i want to do is paint man because its in me and i need to get it out i need to open up this throat i need to i need to    yeah yeah
theres a soft strange sound as i lay down the last streak of black i pause and look around confused for a momentand then the throat sighs behind me a big heavy gust of moist air tickles the hairs on my skin im not scared this is why i did it though i didnt realize that when i started not sure how i know now but when i turn back its still just paint on a rooftop
paulo wasnt shitting me huh or maybe my mama was right and i aint never been right in the head
i jump into the air and whoop for joy and i dont even know why
i spend the next two days going all over the city drawing breathingholes everywhere till my paint runs out
im so tired on the day i meet paulo again that i stumble and nearly fall through the cafes plateglass window he catches my elbow and drags me over to a bench meant for customers youre hearing it he says he sounds pleased
im hearing coffee i suggest not bothering to stifle a yawn a cop car rolls by im not too tired to imagine myself as nothing beneath notice not even worth beating for pleasure it works again they roll on
paulo ignores my suggestion he sits down beside me and his gaze goes strange and unfocused for a moment yes the city is breathing easier he says youre doing a good job even without training
i try
he looks amused i cant tell if you dont believe me or if you just dont care
i shrug i believe you i also dont care not much because im hungry my stomach growls ive still got that twenty he gave me but ill take it to that churchplate sale i heard about over on prospect get chicken and rice and greens and cornbread for less than the cost of a freetrade smallbatchroasted latte
he glances down at my stomach when it growls huh i pretend to stretch and scratch above my abs making sure to pull up my shirt a little the artist guy brought a model for us to draw once and pointed to this little ridge of muscle above the hips called apollos belt paulos gaze goes right to it come on come on fishy fishy i need somewhere to sleep
then his eyes narrow and focus on mine again i had forgotten he says in a faint wondering tone i almost    its been so long once though i was a boy of the favelas
not a lot of mexican food in new york i reply
he blinks and looks amused again then he sobers this city will die he says he doesnt raise his voice but he doesnt have to im paying attention now food living these things have meaning to me if you do not learn the things i have to teach you if you do not help the time will come and you will fail and this city will join pompeii and atlantis and a dozen others whose names no one remembers even though hundreds of thousands of people died with them or perhaps there will be a stillbirththe shell of the city surviving to possibly grow again in the future but its vital spark snuffed for now like new orleansbut that will still kill you either way you are the catalyst whether of strength or destruction
hes been talking like this since he showed upplaces that never were things that cant be omens and portents i figure its bullshit because hes telling it to me a kid whose own mama kicked him out and prays for him to die every day and probably hates me god hates me and i fucking hate god back so why would he choose me for anything but thats really why i start paying attention because of god i dont have to believe in something for it to fuck up my life
tell me what to do i say
paulo nods looking smug thinks hes got my number ah you dont want to die
i stand up stretch feel the streets around me grow longer and more pliable in the rising heat of day is that really happening or am i imagining it or is it happening and im imagining that its connected to me somehow fuck you that aint it
then you dont even care about that he makes it a question with the tone of his voice
aint about being alive ill starve to death someday or freeze some winter night or catch something that rots me away until the hospitals have to take me even without money or an address but ill sing and paint and dance and fuck and cry the city before im done because its mine its fucking mine thats why
its about living i finish and then i turn to glare at him he can kiss my ass if he doesnt understand tell me what to do
something changes in paulos face hes listening now to me so he gets to his feet and leads me away for my first real lesson
this is the lesson great cities are like any other living things being born and maturing and wearying and dying in their turn
duh right everyone whos visited a real city feels that one way or another all those rural people who hate cities are afraid of something legit cities really are different they make a weight on the world a tear in the fabric of reality like    like black holes maybe yeah i go to museums sometimes theyre cool inside and neil degrasse tyson is hot as more and more people come in and deposit their strangeness and leave and get replaced by others the tear widens eventually it gets so deep that it forms a pocket connected only by the thinnest thread of    something to    something whatever cities are made of
but the separation starts a process and in that pocket the many parts of the city begin to multiply and differentiate its sewers extend into places where there is no need for water its slums grow teeth its art centers claws ordinary things within it traffic and construction and stuff like that start to have a rhythm like a heartbeat if you record their sounds and play them back fast the city    quickens
not all cities make it this far there used to be a couple of great cities on this continent but that was before columbus fucked the indians shit up so we had to start over new orleans failed like paulo said but it survived and thats something it can try again mexico citys well on its way but new york is the first american city to reach this point
the gestation can take twenty years or two hundred or two thousand but eventually the time will come the cord is cut and the city becomes a thing of its own able to stand on wobbly legs and do    well whatever the fuck a living thinking entity shaped like a bigass city wants to do
and just as in any other part of nature there are things lying in wait for this moment hoping to chase down the sweet new life and swallow its guts while it screams
thats why paulos here to teach me thats why i can clear the citys breathing and stretch and massage its asphalt limbs im the midwife see
i run the city i run it every fucking day
paulo takes me home its just somebodys summer sublet in the lower east side but it feels like a home i use his shower and eat some of the food in his fridge without asking just to see what hell do he doesnt do shit except smoke a cigarette i think to piss me off i can hear sirens on the streets of the neighborhoodfrequent close i wonder for some reason if theyre looking for me i dont say it aloud but paulo sees me twitching he says the harbingers of the enemy will hide among the citys parasites beware of them
hes always saying cryptic shit like this some of it makes sense like when he speculates that maybe theres a purpose to all of it some reason for the great cities and the process that makes them what the enemy has been doingattacking at the moment of vulnerability crimes of opportunitymight just be the warmup for something bigger but paulos full of shit too like when he says i should consider meditation to better attune myself to the citys needs like imma get through this on whitegirl yoga
whitegirl yoga paulo says nodding indian man yoga stockbroker racquetball and schoolboy handball ballet and merengue union halls and soho galleries you will embody a city of millions you need not be them but know that they are part of you
i laugh racquetball that shit aint no part of me chico
the city chose you out of all paulo says their lives depend on you
maybe but im still hungry and tired all the time scared all the time never safe what good does it do to be valuable if nobody values you
he can tell i dont wanna talk anymore so he gets up and goes to bed i flop on the couch and im dead to the world dead
dreaming dead dreaming of a dark place beneath heavy cold waves where something stirs with a slithery sound and uncoils and turns toward the mouth of the hudson where it empties into the sea toward me and i am too weak too helpless too immobilized by fear to do anything but twitch beneath its predatory gaze
something comes from far to the south somehow none of this is quite real everything rides along the thin tether that connects the citys reality to that of the world the effect happens in the world paulo has said the cause centers around me it moves between me wherever i am and the uncurling thing wherever it is an immensity protects me just this once just in this placethough from a great distance i feel others hemming and grumbling and raising themselves to readiness warning the enemy that it must adhere to the rules of engagement that have always governed this ancient battle its not allowed to come at me too soon
my protector in this unreal space of dream is a sprawling jewel with filthcrusted facets a thing that stinks of dark coffee and the bruised grass of a futebol pitch and traffic noise and familiar cigarette smoke its threat display of sabershaped girders lasts for only a moment but that is enough the uncurling thing flinches back into its cold cave resentfully but it will be back that too is tradition
i wake with sunlight warming half my face just a dream i stumble into the room where paulo is sleeping sao paulo i whisper but he does not wake i wiggle under his covers when he wakes he doesnt reach for me but he doesnt push me away either i let him know im grateful and give him a reason to let me back in later the restll have to wait till i get condoms and he brushes his ashyass mouth after that i use his shower again put on the clothes i washed in his sink and head out while hes still snoring
libraries are safe places theyre warm in the winter nobody cares if you stay all day as long as youre not eyeballing the kids corner or trying to hit up porn on the computers the one at fortysecondthe one with the lionsisnt that kind of library it doesnt lend out books still it has a librarys safety so i sit in a corner and read everything within reach municipal tax law birds of the hudson valley what to expect when youre expecting a city baby nyc edition see paulo i told you i was listening
it gets to be late afternoon and i head outside people cover the steps laughing chatting mugging with selfie sticks therere cops in body armor over by the subway entrance showing off their guns to the tourists so theyll feel safe from new york i get a polish sausage and eat it at the feet of one of the lions fortitude not patience i know my strengths
im full of meat and relaxed and thinking about stuff that aint actually importantlike how long paulo will let me stay and whether i can use his address to apply for stuffso im not watching the street until cold prickles skitter over my side i know what it is before i react but im careless again because i turn to look    stupid stupid i fucking know better cops down in baltimore broke a mans spine for making eye contact but as i spot these two on the corner opposite the library stepsshort pale man and tall dark woman both in blue like blacki notice something that actually breaks my fear because its so strange
its a bright clear day not a cloud in the sky people walking past the cops leave short stark afternoon shadows barely there at all but around these two the shadows pool and curl as if they stand beneath their own private roiling thundercloud and as i watch the shorter one begins to    stretch sort of his shape warping ever so slightly until one eye is twice the circumference of the other his right shoulder slowly develops a bulge that suggests a dislocated joint his companion doesnt seem to notice
yooooo nope i get up and start picking my way through the crowd on the steps im doing that thing i do trying to shunt off their gazebut it feels different this time sticky sort of threads of cheapshit gum fucking up my mirrors i feel them start following me something immense and wrong shifting in my direction
even then im not surea lot of real cops drip and pulse sadism in the same waybut i aint taking chances my city is helpless unborn as yet and paulo aint here to protect me i gotta look out for self same as always
i play casual till i reach the corner and book it or try fucking tourists they idle along the wrong side of the sidewalk stopping to look at maps and take pictures of shit nobody else gives a fuck about im so busy cussing them out in my head that i forget they can also be dangerous somebody yells and grabs my arm as i heisman past and i hear a man yell out he tried to take her purse as i wrench away bitch i aint took shit i think but its too late i see another tourist reaching for her phone to call every cop in the area will be gunning for every black male aged whatever now
i gotta get out of the area
grand centrals right there sweet subway promise but i see three cops hanging out in the entrance so i swerve right to take fortyfirst the crowds thin out past lex but where can i go i sprint across third despite the traffic there are enough gaps but im getting tired cause im a scrawny dude who doesnt get enough to eat not a track star
i keep going though even through the burn in my side i can feel those cops the harbingers of the enemy not far behind me the ground shakes with their lumpen footfalls
i hear a siren about a block away closing shit the uns coming up i dont need the secret service or whatever on me too i jag left through an alley and trip over a wooden pallet lucky againa cop car rolls by the alley entrance just as i go down and they dont see me i stay down and try to catch my breath till i hear the cars engine fading into the distance then when i think its safe i push up look back because the city is squirming around me the concrete is jittering and heaving everything from the bedrock to the rooftop bars is trying its damnedest to tell me to go go go
crowding the alley behind me is    is    the shit i dont have words for it too many arms too many legs too many eyes and all of them fixed on me somewhere in the mass i glimpse curls of dark hair and a scalp of pale blond and i understand suddenly that these arethis ismy two cops one real monstrosity the walls of the alley crack as it oozes its way into the narrow space
oh fuck no i gasp
i claw my way to my feet and haul ass a patrol car comes around the corner from second avenue and i dont see it in time to duck out of sight the cars loudspeaker blares something unintelligible probably im gonna kill you and im actually amazed do they not see the thing behind me or do they just not give a shit because they cant shake it down for city revenue let them fucking shoot me better than whatever that thing will do
i hook left onto second avenue the cop car cant come after me against the traffic but its not like thatll stop some doubledcop monster fortyfifth fortyseventh and my legs are molten granite fiftieth and i think im going to die heart attack far too young poor kid shouldve eaten more organic shouldve taken it easy and not been so angry the world cant hurt you if you just ignore everything thats wrong with it well not until it kills you anyway
i cross the street and risk a look back and see something roll onto the sidewalk on at least eight legs using three or four arms to push itself off a building as it careens a little    before coming straight after me again its the mega cop and its gaining oh shit oh shit oh shit please no
only one choice
swing right fiftythird against the traffic an old folks home a park a promenade    fuck those pedestrian bridge fuck that i head straight for the six lanes of utter batshittery and potholes that is fdr drive do not pass go do not try to cross on foot unless you want to be smeared halfway to brooklyn beyond it the east river if i survive im even freaked out enough to try swimming in that fucking sewage but im probably gonna collapse in the third lane and get run over fifty times before anybody thinks to put on brakes
behind me the mega cop utters a wet tumid hough like its clearing its throat for swallowing i go
over the barrier and through the grass into fucking hell i go one lane silver car two lanes horns horns horns three lanes semi whats a fucking semi doing on the fdr its too tall you stupid upstate hick screaming four lanes green taxi screaming smart car hahaha cute five lanes moving truck six lanes and the blue lexus actually brushes up against my clothes as it blares past screaming screaming screaming
screaming
screaming metal and tires as reality stretches and nothing stops for the mega cop it does not belong here and the fdr is an artery vital with the movement of nutrients and strength and attitude and adrenaline the cars are white blood cells and the thing is an irritant an infection an invader to whom the city gives no consideration and no quarter
screaming as the mega cop is torn to pieces by the semi and the taxi and the lexus and even that adorable smart car which actually swerves a little to run over an extrawiggly piece i collapse onto a square of grass breathless shaking wheezing and can only stare as a dozen limbs are crushed two dozen eyes squashed flat a mouth that is mostly gums riven from jaw to palate the pieces flicker like a monitor with an av cable short translucent to solid and back againbut fdr dont stop for shit except a presidential motorcade or a knicks game and this thing sure as hell aint carmelo anthony pretty soon theres nothing left of it but halfreal smears on the asphalt
im alive oh god
i cry for a little while mamas boyfriend aint here to slap me and say im not a man for it daddy wouldve said it was okaytears mean youre alivebut daddys dead and im alive
with limbs burning and weak i drag myself up then fall again everything hurts is this that heart attack i feel sick everything is shaking blurring maybe its a stroke you dont have to be old for that to happen do you i stumble over to a garbage can and think about throwing up into it theres an old guy lying on the benchme in twenty years if i make it that far he opens one eye as i stand there gagging and purses his lips in a judgy way like he could do better dryheaves in his sleep
he says its time and rolls over to put his back to me
time suddenly i have to move sick or not exhausted or not something is    pulling me west toward the citys center i push away from the can and hug myself as i shiver and stumble toward the pedestrian bridge as i walk over the lanes i previously ran across i look down onto flickering fragments of the dead mega cop now ground into the asphalt by a hundred car wheels some globules of it are still twitching and i dont like that infection intrusion i want it gone
we want it gone yes its time
i blink and suddenly im in central park how the fuck did i get here disoriented i realize only as i see their black shoes that im passing another pair of cops but these two dont bother me they shouldskinny kid shivering like hes cold on a june day even if all they do is drag me off somewhere to shove a plunger up my ass they should react to me instead its like im not there miracles exist ralph ellison was right any nypd you can walk away from hallelujah
the lake bow bridge a place of transition i stop here stand here and i know    everything
everything paulos told me its true somewhere beyond the city the enemy is awakening it sent forth its harbingers and they have failed but its taint is in the city now spreading with every car that passes over every nowmicroscopic iota of the mega cops substance and this creates a foothold the enemy uses this anchor to drag itself up from the dark toward the world toward the warmth and light toward the defiance that is me toward the burgeoning wholeness that is my city this attack is not all of it of course what comes is only the smallest fraction of the enemys old old evilbut that should be more than enough to slaughter one lowly wornout kid who doesnt even have a real city to protect him
not yet its time in time well see
on second sixth and eighth avenues my water breaks mains i mean water mains terrible mess gonna fuck up the evening commute i shut my eyes and i am seeing what no one else sees i am feeling the flex and rhythm of reality the contractions of possibility i reach out and grip the railing of the bridge before me and feel the steady strong pulse that runs through it youre doing good baby doing great
something begins to shift i grow bigger encompassing i feel myself upon the firmament heavy as the foundations of a city there are others here with me looming watchingmy ancestors bones under wall street my predecessors blood ground into the benches of christopher park no new others of my new people heavy imprints upon the fabric of time and space sao paulo squats nearest its roots stretching all the way to the bones of dead machu picchu watching sagely and twitching a little with the memory of its own relatively recent traumatic birth paris observes with distant disinterest mildly offended that any city of our tasteless upstart land has managed this transition lagos exults to see a new fellow who knows the hustle the hype the fight and more many more all of them watching waiting to see if their numbers increase or not if nothing else they will bear witness that i we were great for one shining moment
well make it i say squeezing the railing and feeling the city contract all over the city peoples ears pop and they look around in confusion just a little more come on im scared but theres no rushing this lo que pasa pasadamn now that song is in my head in me like the rest of new york its all here just like paulo said theres no gap between me and the city anymore
and as the firmament ripples slides tears the enemy writhes up from the deeps with a realitybridging roar
but it is too late the tether is cut and we are here we become we stand whole and hale and independent and our legs dont even wobble we got this dont sleep on the city that never sleeps son and dont fucking bring your squamous eldritch bullshit here
i raise my arms and avenues leap its real but its not the ground jolts and people think huh subways really shaky today i brace my feet and they are girders anchors bedrock the beast of the deeps shrieks and i laugh giddy with postpartum endorphins bring it and when it comes at me i hipcheck it with the bqe backhand it with inwood park drop the south bronx on it like an elbow on the evening news that night ten construction sites will report wreckingball collapses city safety regulations are so lax terrible terrible the enemy tries some kind of fuckedup wiggly shitits all tentaclesand i snarl and bite into it cause new yorkers eat damn near as much sushi as tokyo mercury and all
oh now youre crying now you wanna run nah son you came to the wrong town i curb stomp it with the full might of queens and something inside the beast breaks and bleeds iridescence all over creation this is a shock for it has not been truly hurt in centuries it lashes back in a fury faster than i can block and from a place that most of the city cannot see a skyscraperlong tentacle curls out of nowhere to smash into new york harbor i scream and fall i can hear my ribs crack andnoa major earthquake shakes brooklyn for the first time in decades the williamsburg bridge twists and snaps apart like kindling the manhattan groans and splinters though thankfully it does not give way i feel every death as if it is my own
fucking kill you for that bitch im notthinking the fury and grief have driven me into a vengeful fugue the pain is nothing this aint my first rodeo through the groan of my ribs i drag myself upright and brace my legs in a pissingofftheplatform stance then i shower the enemy with a onetwo punch of long island radiation and gowanus toxic waste which burn it like acid it screams again in pain and disgust but fuck you you dont belong here this city is mine get out to drive this lesson home i cut the bitch with lirr traffic long vicious honking lines and to stretch out its pain i salt these wounds with the memory of a bus ride to laguardia and back
and just to add insult to injury i backhand its ass with hoboken raining the drunk rage of ten thousand dudebros down on it like the hammer of god port authority makes it honorary new york motherfucker you just got jerseyed
the enemy is as quintessential to nature as any city we cannot be stopped from becoming and the enemy cannot be made to end i hurt only a small part of itbut i know damn well i sent that part back broken good time ever comes for that final confrontation itll think twice about taking me on again
me us yes
when i relax my hands and open my eyes to see paulo striding along the bridge toward me with another goddamned cigarette between his lips i fleetingly see him for what he is again the sprawling thing from my dream all sparkling spires and reeking slums and stolen rhythms made over with genteel cruelty i know that he glimpses what i am too all the bright light and bluster of me maybe hes always seen it but there is admiration in his gaze now and i like it he comes to help support me with his shoulder and he says congratulations and i grin
i live the city it thrives and it is mine i am its worthy avatar and together we will never be afraid again
fifty years later
i sit in a car watching the sunset from mulholland drive the car is mine im rich now the city is not mine but thats all right the person is coming who will make it live and stand and thrive in the ancient way    or not i know my duty respect the traditions each city must emerge on its own or die trying we elders merely guide encourage stand witness
there a dip in the firmament near the sunset strip i can feel the upwelling of loneliness in the soul i seek poor empty baby wont be long now though soonif she survivesshell never be alone again
i reach for my city so far away so inseverable from myself ready i ask new york
fuck yeah it answers filthy and fierce
we go forth to find this citys singer and hopefully to hear the greatness of its birthing song
